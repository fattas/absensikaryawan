# Face-API.js Models

This directory should contain the face-api.js model files. You need to download these files from the face-api.js GitHub repository and place them in this directory.

## Required Model Files

The following model files are required for the application to work properly:

1. `tiny_face_detector_model-*`
2. `face_landmark_68_model-*`
3. `face_recognition_model-*`

## How to Get the Models

1. Download the models from the [face-api.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights)
2. Extract and place all model files in this directory
3. Refresh the application

## Alternative: Use a CDN

If you prefer, you can modify the code to load the models from a CDN instead of hosting them locally.
